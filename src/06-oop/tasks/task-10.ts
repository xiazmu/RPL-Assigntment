/**
 * An e-commerce company supports several shipping services.
 * Every shipment contains:
 * - Tracking number
 * - Destination
 * - Package weight
 * 
 * However, each shipping service calculates its shipping cost differently.
 * - Regular Shipping: 10000 / kg
 * - Express Shipping: 20000 / kg
 * - Same-day Shipping: 30000 / kg
 * 
 * Example shipments:
 * ---------------------
 * Tracking: REG001
 * Destination: Malang
 * Weight: 3 kg
 * ---------------------
 * Tracking: EXP001
 * Destination: Surabaya
 * Weight: 2 kg
 * ---------------------
 * Tracking: SMD001
 * Destination: Jakarta
 * Weight: 4 kg
 * ---------------------
 * 
 * Tasks:
 * - Create class Shipping with appropriate properties and method "calculateCost()"
 * - Create children class of Notification such as RegularShipping, ExpressShipping, SameDayShipping
 * - each child should override "calculateCost()"
 * - add another shipping type "InternationalShipping" with cost 100.000 / kg
 * - protect "package weight" in order to another class can't access it directly. Use method "getWeight"
 * for get value of package weight
